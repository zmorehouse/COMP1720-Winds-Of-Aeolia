This is an outstanding submission, depicting an abstract interpretation of a wind instrument. You've employed some highly sophisticated concepts here, creating a piece that is beautiful, organic, and finds the perfect balance between capturing the mystery and fluidity of the natural world while still giving the user some creative control. Your artist statement is excellent, critically discussing design choices and relating them to your theme. In particular your discussion around the sound choices and your avoidance of rigidity to better capture those wind-like qualities was great. Really well done!

In terms of interactions, these were highly sophisticated, expressive and enhanced the viewer's experience. I almost feel guilty for docking half a mark here because these interactions were really immersive and engaging in their fluidity. However, my one knit-pick is that I wish the the visuals effected the audio in the same way that the audio effects the visuals. I really liked that the strings moved more or less depending on the intensity of the wind sound, and I think it would be great if the inverse was true as well. Say the user clicks 20 times on the left of the screen, causing the wind to blow strongly to the right, it would be cool if the background audio increased in volume. Similarly, when the strings are mostly still in the middle of the screen, it doesn't really make sense for the wind sound in the background to be just as loud as before.

In terms of program design, this was highly sophisticated, supporting a really unique and engaging viewing experience. Well done!
