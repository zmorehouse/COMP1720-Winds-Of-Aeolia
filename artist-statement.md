# Artist Statement

"Winds of Aeolia" is an abstract interpretation of the Aeolian harp, an ancient Grecian musical instrument played by the wind. The artwork depicts the harp’s free-flowing strings as they sway in shifting winds, exploring the organic randomness of nature and the unpredictable yet constrained forces that guide it. Through smooth, fluid movements, the piece embodies both the serenity and chaos inherent in the untamed, infinite qualities of wind.

Aurally, the design seeks to capture the essence of an Aeolian harp, with the strings mapped to harmonic tones within the C Major Pentatonic scale - notes typical of the instrument. Layered beneath this is sampled wind audio, with the intensity of the piece dynamically tied to the strength of the wind sounds, enhancing the immersive experience.

Interaction is at the heart of the piece, allowing the viewer to act as the wind. With loose controls, users can influence the wind’s direction or play the harp. The control scheme is deliberately fluid rather than rigid - there are no sudden shifts or symmetrical patterns. Likewise, users are rarely able to strike a single note without affecting others, reflecting the natural, interwoven harmonies of traditional Aeolian harps.

As the viewer embodies the wind, their connection to the artwork deepens, offering a sense of control tempered by nature’s imperfect beauty, where structured music and spontaneous sound flow together in harmony.
